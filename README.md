## Project name: SMART DOOR 

#### Idea: 
a smart door, which opens automatically if it recognizes people in front of it, is connected to the Internet, which allows it to warn the smartphone or other electronic device of the owner of the house when a stranger enters at the entrance!

#### Explanation: 
* 1st-Version :
if a person is in front of the door, it opens automatically if it's recognized by notifying the owner that the person has returned to his home, if the person is foreign (the device doesn't recognize the person), a warning is sent to the owner of the house who can accept or refuse to open the door (he has the possibility to add this person in the list of people that the door can recognize)
the idea of this project resembles the project of august smart lock. 
here is a useful link to explain :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMln85LNENo

* 2sd-Version : 
the purpose of the second version is to improve the security side of the camera.
For example:
We can put a picture of a person in front of the camera and this person is recognized by the door.
So we have to detect that this person really exists.

* 3rd-Version :
the third version is still based on improving the security side, another example:
It can happen on a day when a thief forces a person to stand in front of the door because that person can be recognized by the door, and that way he can return. 
So the idea is to open the door based on a model of recognition of emotions.


#### Framework:
* Espressif Systems Audio Development Framework (ESP-ADF): 
		is the official audio development framework for the ESP32 chip.
* TensorFlow:
	    is an open source machine learning tool.

#### Library : 
* Open-cv : 
    a free graphics library, originally developed by Intel, specializing in real-time image processing.


## List of essential components:

     ESP32-Wrover: 
     a powerful, generic WiFi-BT-BLE MCU module that targets a wide
     variety of applications, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks, 
     such as voice encoding, music streaming and MP3 decoding.
#### OR
	  ESP32-EYE:
    this is Espressif’s new AI development board featuring voice wakeup, as well as face
	  detection and recognition. It has been built around our flagship chip, ESP32, and it is also equipped 
    with a 2-Megapixel OV 2640 Camera, Microphone, 4 MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM, Micro USB and LED lights on a 21mm × 41mm board”
